# CS552-Group-Project
Group project for CS552. Tasked with making a simple processor. Work done in verilog, but we were not allowed to use any of the fancy features available in verilog (limited to modules, wires, bitwise logic, etc., not allowed to use ifs and other higher level structures).

Team: Lucas Smith, Michael Feist, Sean Staggs
